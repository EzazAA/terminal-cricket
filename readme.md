# Cricket Terminal Game

A simple terminal-based cricket game where you can bat and bowl against the computer. Challenge the CPU in this fun, quick game of hand-cricket right from your terminal!

## Features

- Play a text-based cricket game in your terminal.
- Choose between batting and bowling.
- Randomized decisions by the computer to simulate a real cricket match.
- Colorful output to enhance the gaming experience (using `colorama`).

## Requirements

- **Python** 3.6 or higher

## Installation

Follow these steps to install and play the game on your local machine:

1. **PyPi package** :

   ```


## Running the Game

Once the game is installed, you can run it using the following command in your terminal:

## How to Play

- **Batting**: 
  - You'll be prompted to choose a number between 1 and 6 (like cricket runs). 
  - The computer will randomly choose a number. 
  - If both numbers match, you're out. Otherwise, you score runs equal to your choice.

- **Bowling**: 
  - You choose a number between 1 and 6 to bowl. 
  - The computer will randomly choose a number for its batting. 
  - If both numbers match, the computer is out. Otherwise, the computer scores.

After both batting and bowling, the game will calculate the final score, and the winner will be announced.
